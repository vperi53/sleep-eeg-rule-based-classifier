# Sleep EEG Rule-Based Classifier

This repository contains the full pipeline for EEG signal processing and rule-based sleep stage classification using the Sleep-EDF Expanded Dataset (2013). The framework includes preprocessing, amplitude and power feature extraction (Hilbert, Welch, STFT), and stage classification with validation via expert-annotated hypnograms.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- EEG Preprocessing (Butterworth bandpass filtering)
- Amplitude analysis using Hilbert Transform
- Power Spectral Density (PSD) using Welchâ€™s method
- Time-Frequency analysis using STFT
- Rule-Based Classifier using feature thresholds and band ratios
- Hypnogram generation
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall



## ðŸ§ª Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- mne
- yasa
- numpy, scipy, pandas
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
conda env create -f environment.yml
