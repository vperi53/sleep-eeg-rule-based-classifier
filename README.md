# Sleep EEG Rule-Based Classifier

This repository contains the full pipeline for EEG signal processing and rule-based sleep stage classification using the Sleep-EDF Expanded Dataset (2013). The framework includes preprocessing, amplitude and power feature extraction (Hilbert, Welch, STFT), and stage classification with validation via expert-annotated hypnograms.

SleepStageClassifier
Overview

SleepStageClassifier is a signal processing framework that automates sleep stage classification using full-night EEG recordings from the Sleep-EDF Database. Using frequency domain analysis, amplitude envelopes, and domain-specific thresholds, this rule-based system classifies EEG signals into standard AASM-defined stages: Wake, N1, N2, N3, and REM.

This project uses open-source libraries such as MNE, YASA, SciPy, and NumPy to process EEG recordings and generate hypnograms validated against expert annotations.

Features
EEG Preprocessing: Butterworth bandpass filtering and artifact mitigation.
Sleep Stage Classification: Rule-based system using Delta/Theta/Alpha dominance, ratios, and temporal smoothing.
Spectral and Temporal Analysis: Extracts Welchâ€™s PSD, STFT-based spectrograms, and Hilbert amplitude envelopes.
Event Detection: Identifies spindles, K-complexes, and bursts using YASAâ€™s detection API.
Full-Night Hypnogram Generation: Creates and validates sleep architecture using expert-labeled hypnograms.
Visualization: Stage-wise PSDs, amplitude tables, and frequency transitions plotted with Matplotlib.

Methodology
1. Data Source

Dataset: Sleep-EDF Expanded (2013)
Format: Polysomnographic (PSG) .edf recordings and expert-labeled hypnograms.
Channels Used: Fpz-Cz, Pz-Oz.
2. Preprocessing

Sampling Rate: 100 Hz
Filter: 0.5â€“30 Hz Butterworth
Segmentation: 30-second epochs
3. Feature Extraction

Welchâ€™s PSD: Computes absolute/relative band power in Delta (0.5â€“4 Hz), Theta (4â€“8 Hz), Alpha (8â€“12 Hz) bands.
STFT: Short-Time Fourier Transform to detect time-varying spectral events.
Hilbert Transform: Instantaneous amplitude envelopes for sleep-related transient detection.
Spindle/K-Complex Detection: YASAâ€™s rule-based detectors.
4. Classification

Rule-Based Classifier:
Delta power â†’ N3
Spindles/K-complexes â†’ N2
Theta dominance â†’ N1
Mixed alpha â†’ Wake
Smoothing: Majority voting across neighbors for robustness
Output: Hypnogram
5. Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, Cohenâ€™s Kappa, Stage-wise F1 Scores
Compared against: Expert hypnograms from PhysioNet
