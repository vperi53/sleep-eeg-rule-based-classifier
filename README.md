# Sleep EEG Rule-Based Classifier

This repository contains the full pipeline for EEG signal processing and rule-based sleep stage classification using the Sleep-EDF Expanded Dataset (2013). The framework includes preprocessing, amplitude and power feature extraction (Hilbert, Welch, STFT), and stage classification with validation via expert-annotated hypnograms.

## 📦 Features

- EEG Preprocessing (Butterworth bandpass filtering)
- Amplitude analysis using Hilbert Transform
- Power Spectral Density (PSD) using Welch’s method
- Time-Frequency analysis using STFT
- Rule-Based Classifier using feature thresholds and band ratios
- Hypnogram generation
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall
